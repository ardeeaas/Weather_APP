by pressing the "Press to get country" button the app will show the country that the coordinates belong to.

For informations regarding the weather the app calls the openweather API (https://openweathermap.org/api) and for the geographical pinpoint the Geonames API(https://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html). Both API's required latitude and longitude as info which were the informations that the user inputs into the app. The OpenWeather API also needs an API key which was provided by the organization, while the geoNames API uses a username which was set by me when creating the account.
